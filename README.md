# iss294-algorithms
First assignment for algorithms unit - playing with fractals.

Click and drag in empty space to begin drawing. On release, a fractal is drawn. This fractal can then be used as a "brush", either dragging it around the screen, or rotating it by holding the 'a' key or space bar while dragging. The 'a' key will slowly rotate the fractal, while the space bar will cause a much more sporadic rotation. The 'r' key can be pressed to reset the canvas.
